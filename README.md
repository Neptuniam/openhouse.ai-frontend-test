## Exercise
OpenHouse.ai Front End Exercise



### Notes
Originally, I interpreted that the statement "The average price of all the homes associated with that community" meant to filter out any properties of type not "House" and included that in my filter conditions.

I eventually decided not to do this as it greatly limited my data to display on the front end.


I use only one dependencies, that being axios which is what is used to perform the REST GET operation. I decided to use two CSS frameworks, listed below, solely for the purpose that I am familiar with them and they made the process a lot easier.
Flexbox is a grid system used to make the site mobile responsive.
Generally I avoid CDNs for efficiency and consistency but wanted to keep this simple.
